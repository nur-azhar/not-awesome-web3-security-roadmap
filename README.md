# Not so awesome Web3 Security Researcher roadmap

Of course, this is not awesome. This is not the curated list of blue underlined [words](https://blank.page/) that you will click, read, and jump to the next one, hoping to finish as fast as possible—or maybe hoping not to finish at all. You are going to become a security **RESEARCHER**. Yeah, **RESEARCHER**. No one is going to find vulnerabilities for you or point out the functions where they are hiding. You are going to have to dig, **research**, and find them **yourself**. So the path to becoming a security researcher? It’s all about research.

If you really want to become a Web3 Security Researcher, let’s set this straight from the start: **there are no deadlines**. If you are thinking “2 months, 6 months, 1 year, 10 years” to become a researcher, forget those timelines. Relax. The only rule is to never waste a single day without learning something new. And yes, read this to the end!

## Introduction

Alright, before we get too deep into this, let me introduce myself. I am Tigran Piliposyan (@tpiliposian), a Security Researcher at [Hexens](https://hexens.io/) for over a year now. I’m not here to pretend I’m some all-knowing security wizard sitting and cracking smart contracts left and right. No, I’m just someone who started from **ABSOLUTE** zero at age 29, leaving my previous workplace, with a family and two daughters to care for, and starting something completely new. I didn’t even know that there was a Web2, and now suddenly it’s Web3, or what blockchain even was! I didn’t know any programming languages either. (A bit more about that story [here](https://x.com/tpiliposian/status/1699805833167614299)).

I learned everything I could find. I went through all the roadmaps, consumed every piece of content available, and to be honest, it was kind of funny. It felt like the true start of a researcher’s journey, which I guess is the right way to begin. But once I actually started working, looking back, I realized I had wasted a lot of time simply because I didn’t know what to read or listen to first, what should come before or after. If someone had just sat down with me and told me step by step what to research, it would have been amazing.

Yes, the Hexens team helped me, but they couldn’t sit with me all day long. Plus, I was still working at the Central Bank, so I had to juggle this in parallel. It’s been a grind. And I always had this idea: instead of the typical roadmap we’re all used to, I wanted to write something different—something that feels like someone is sitting with you, guiding you on your journey to becoming a security researcher.

And if you’re reading this, I’m guessing you’re ready for the same kind of grind—minus a few bumps and bruises because, hey, I’ve made enough mistakes for both of us.
