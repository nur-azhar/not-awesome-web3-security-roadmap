# Not so awesome Web3 Security Researcher roadmap

Of course, this is not awesome. This is not the curated list of blue underlined [words](https://blank.page/) that you will click, read, and jump to the next one, hoping to finish as fast as possible—or maybe hoping not to finish at all. You are going to become a security **RESEARCHER**. Yeah, **RESEARCHER**. No one is going to find vulnerabilities for you or point out the functions where they are hiding. You are going to have to dig, **research**, and find them **yourself**. So the path to becoming a security researcher? It’s all about research.

If you really want to become a Web3 Security Researcher, let’s set this straight from the start: **there are no deadlines**. If you are thinking “2 months, 6 months, 1 year, 10 years” to become a researcher, forget those timelines. Relax. The only rule is to never waste a single day without learning something new. And yes, read this to the end!

## Introduction

Alright, before we get too deep into this, let me introduce myself. I am Tigran Piliposyan (@tpiliposian), a Security Researcher at [Hexens](https://hexens.io/) for over a year now. I’m not here to pretend I’m some all-knowing security wizard sitting and cracking smart contracts left and right. No, I’m just someone who started from **ABSOLUTE** zero at age 29, leaving my previous workplace, with a family and two daughters to care for, and starting something completely new. I didn’t even know that there was a Web2, and now suddenly it’s Web3, or what blockchain even was! (A bit more about that story [here](https://x.com/tpiliposian/status/1699805833167614299)).
